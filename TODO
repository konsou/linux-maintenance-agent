Agent requested these:

- Full logging of messages

1. A function to automatically gather detailed system information like model, specs, installed apps/drivers etc. This would reduce the need to run multiple commands and prevent making incorrect assumptions.

2. The ability to actually download files like drivers from safe/verified sources. Then I could provide the files directly instead of just URLs.

3. Access to a knowledge base of common issues/solutions for different systems. This could help me quickly identify and resolve recurring problems.

4. Integration with remote desktop/assistance tools so I could securely view the user's screen and troubleshoot directly if needed.
